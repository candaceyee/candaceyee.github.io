  <h3>After Finals Update! (May 15, 2020)</h3>
  <p>finals are over now, so i thought i would celebrate by posting old photos here. these six photos are from 2015 and 2016, and they were each taken in a different country. so i guess it's up to you to figure out where each of them are from.</p>
  <p>P.S. some of the photos are bad because i was 15 or 16 when they were taken :(</p>
  <p>P.P.S. I was just informed that this is too difficult without a word bank, so here's a word bank in no particular order: Canada, Germany, Italy, Spain, Switzerland, USA</p>
  <p>P.P.P.S. If you're going to look at my Instagram for answers, stop it. That's cheating. </p>

  <h3>Candace Recommends, Ep. 1 (July 13, 2019)</h3>
  <p>On this episode of <i><b>Candace Recommends</b></i>, I'm going to talk a little bit about my favorite hiking trail. It's a loop trail in the Andrew Molera State Park in Big Sur involving three trailsâ€” the Ridge, Panorama, and Bluffs Trails. It's about six miles long, and my preferred method of hiking this loop is to start out on the Ridge Trail, although you can choose to start with the Bluffs Trail. </p> 
  <p>One of my favorite aspects of the trail is its varied lanscapes, from steep green hills to shaded redwood groves to seaside bluffs. The Ridge Trail is pretty steep, but as soon as you get to the viewpoint at start of the Panorama Trail, it all goes downhill from there. If you ever find yourself in the area, I would 10/10 reccomend this trail.</p>
  <p>You should be warned that during winter, the footbridge to cross the stream right before the start of the trails is taken away, and you need to cross the stream by taking off your shoes and wading through freezing cold water. Happy Hiking :) </p>

  <h3>More Than a Week Later (June 5, 2019)</h3>
  <p>well it's been a very long time since i last posted something on here. i still haven't figured out Jekyll yet so i'll suppose i'll just talk about my life.</p>
  <p>i spent a very long time a week and a half ago vacuum filtering samples for my lab, and i had the oppertunity to listen to hours and hours of music while doing so, so i think i'm pretty qualified to make a playlist for all your vacuum filtering needs. feel free to also use this even if you're just normal vacuuming.</p>

  <h3>A Couple Days Later (May 23, 2019)</h3>
  <p>...a couple days later, and i still have no idea how to add stuff to this website besides editing this index.html thing. so i thought i would add some of my favorite things in entertainment because clearly everyone wants to know what my favorite podcast is.</p>
  <p><b><i>my favorite podcast</i></b></p>
  <p>i like candice and casey's couples therapy. 8/10 would reccomend.</p>
  <p><b><i>a book i'm currently reading</i></b></p>
  <p>Kafka's The Castle</p> 
  <p>it's okay so far. haven't finished it, so i can't rate it.</p>
  <p><b><i>a show i like</i></b></p>
  <p>i used to watch Bob's Burgers, and that's about it</p>
  <p><b><i>favorite song right now</i></b></p>

  <p><b><i>what i'm doing now that it's summer *sun emoji*</i></b></p>
  <p>i bought a Kodak Fun Saver several days ago, and i'm currently just taking pics of whatever i feel is worthy of being developed. haven't used up all my pics yet, so i also can't rate this. but so far it's been 10/10.</p>
